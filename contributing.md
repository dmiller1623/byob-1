# Contributing to DevConnect

### Thank you for contributing to DevConnect!

We appreciate your potential contribution to DevConnect and love getting pull
requests from everyone. Feel free to contribute to any aspect of the project,
but we would really appreciate contributions that solve one of the project's issues,
or that improve the styling of either "Developers" page, the "Employers" page, or the
"Saved Jobs" page. We look forward to any helpful contributions you make to our project!

## What to know beforehand:

We actively review all pull requests that we receive, but keep in mind that if a
feature does not solve one of the problems listed above, or one of our issues listed
within the issues section of our repo, we cannot guarantee that it will be a final
contribution to DevConnect.

We highly recommend to any potential contributor to review our codebase at https://github.com/brandonfiebiger/dev-connect and review the repo's README in order
to get a taste of the project's style, how we test, and the project overall.

## Claming an issue:

You can do this by selecting any open issue and commenting on it. We ask that
you do not add any new issues without making sure that the particular issue has not
already been accounted for, or that it actually is an issue. We may also ask you to
pick a different issue.

Otherwise, you can feel free to work on something that is not an issue, but know that
your contribution is more likely to be added to our project if it solves an issue.

## Submitting a pull request:

Before submitting a pull request, please review the following:

- You have merged or rebased the most recent changes from master in your branch and no merge conflicts are present.
- You have reviewed anything caught by the linter.
- You have commit messages that are extremely descriptive and accurately explain what exactly was changed (i.e. `Update styling of job cards on Developers page` and not `Fix issue #3`).
- You have run the test suite with `npm run test` and all tests are passing after your addition to the project.
- You have taken the time to add any new tests that test any additional features or functionality.

Thank you again for your contributions!
